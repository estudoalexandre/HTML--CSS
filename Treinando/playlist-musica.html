You can see the writing on the pavement
Young kids, they're growing up in basements
Online, a whole new generation
I'ma make mine, so you better go take it
Old ways, they need a new replacement
Decentralized, can't contain it
We're changing lives, yeah, upgrading
Call it suicide of the older generation
What keeps you up at night, yeah
Make all the demons quiet, yeah
We were built to thrive, yeah
I think that we've all had enough
What keeps you up at night, yeah
Make all the demons quiet, yeah
We were built to thrive, yeah
I think that we've all had enough
Oh yeah, I think that we've all had enough
Sick of dealing with the old plan
They know that we're calling their bluff
You got me like, oh yeah
I think that we've all had enough
Sick of dealing with the old plan
They know that we're calling their bluff
It's too late to try and go contain it
A generation fuelled by creation
We live lives on a small screen nation
We control the airwaves, no negotiation
I refuse to think we need saving
Something good will come from creation
And when we think that the world is too anxious
We'll adapt, evolve, survive and save it
What keeps you up at night, yeah
Make all the demons quiet, yeah
We were built to thrive, yeah
I think that we've all had enough
What keeps you up at night, yeah
Make all the demons quiet, yeah
We were built to thrive, yeah
I think that we've all had enough
Oh yeah, I think that we've all had enough
Sick of dealing with the old plan
They know that we're calling their bluff
You got me like, oh yeah
I think that we've all had enough
Sick of dealing with the old plan
They know that we're calling their bluff
Oh yeah, I think that we've all had enough
Sick of dealing with the old plan
They know that we're calling their bluff
You got me like, oh yeah
I think that we've all had enough
Sick of dealing with the old plan
They know that we're calling their bluff
